# Description: Develop the booking system for water toy rentals with date selection, availability checking, and reservation functionality.
# Details:
1. Create Booking model in MongoDB with fields:

2. Implement backend routes and controllers for bookings:
   - GET /api/bookings (user's bookings)
   - GET /api/bookings/:id
   - POST /api/bookings
   - PUT /api/bookings/:id
   - DELETE /api/bookings/:id
3. Create availability checking logic:
   - Check if product is available for selected dates
   - Handle concurrent booking attempts
4. Implement frontend booking components:
   - Date picker component
   - Availability display
   - Booking form
   - Booking confirmation
5. Create booking validation logic
6. Implement booking status management (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for booking controllers
2. Test booking creation with valid/invalid dates
3. Verify availability checking logic
4. Test concurrent booking scenarios
5. Verify booking status updates
6. Test booking cancellation
