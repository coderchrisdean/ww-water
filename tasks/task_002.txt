2. Implement backend authentication routes and controllers:
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - POST /api/auth/forgot-password
   - POST /api/auth/reset-password
3. Implement JWT token generation and validation
4. Create frontend authentication forms:

   - Login form with validation
   - Forgot password form
   - Password reset form
5. Implement protected routes in frontend
6. Create authentication context/provider for state management

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication controllers
2. Test user registration with valid/invalid data
3. Test login functionality with correct/incorrect credentials
4. Test password reset flow
5. Verify JWT token validation
6. Test protected routes access with/without authentication
